AdColony interstitial ads are a video ad immediately followed by an end-card (described in more detail in the AdColony Product Overview).

###Instructions###
Once you've performed the required [[Project Setup]], you can display an AdColony interstitial ad in your app in three easy steps:

1. Create or sign into your [AdColony account](http://clients.adcolony.com) and retrieve the AdColony app ID and AdColony zone ID for your app.
2. Insert code that runs on app launch to configure AdColony with your app ID and zone ID.
3. Insert code to tell AdColony to play an ad.
